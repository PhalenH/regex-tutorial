# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial will help explain how a specific regular expression functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

A regex, which is short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input and each component of a regex has a unique responsibility to perform said validation.

WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial

WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
